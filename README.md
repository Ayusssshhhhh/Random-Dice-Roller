Hi everyone!!
I have made this random dice roller where you can roll as many dices as you want starting from a minimum number of 1. 
This has been made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
The images of the dices were taken from the website (https://iconduck.com/icons). I have also uploaded them on this repository
It was a fun random project to make.
Do contact me if you think any more changes can be made. It would be appreciated.
